# C_ProjectIAED
My project during the IAED subject, its divided in 2 but the first half was done by our teacher which provided this first part

- About this project: In this first part of the project I was feeling really down and I couldn't understand C at all, but
                      I consider this project one of my favourites because it was my comeback, although the first part went 
                      really bad, the second one went great because the teacher provided us with his first part of the project
                      and said that we could use it for the second part. I believe that seeing this first part made by the teacher
                      really inspired me and made me work like never before; I was understanding C better day by day, and when I
                      tested this project after ending it, it felt like I had surpassed all expectations, and saved my grade in this subject.
                      Because of this amazing comeback and experience, I started to really like C and inspired me to work even harder!
